# LiskWho
LiskWho.io originally created with the idea to build a one stop place to decide who to put your delegate votes too. Also a bit of policing of the delegates as the community can rate and comment on delegates. This way educated individuals can make the right decisions on who deserves a vote.


If you would like to contribute to this project by finishing it up and adding delegate profile pages, comment system using discuss, and delegate validation for them editing their own pages content and not comments. Please do so and make a pull request.

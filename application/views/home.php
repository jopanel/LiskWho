        <p>Lisk is plagued by delegates who receive free Lisk without contributing towards the Lisk community. It's time we change that. It is imperative that the top 101 delegates who earn Lisk from forging are people who are contributing to Lisk and not only "buying" votes by sharing rewards. Delegates must be vetted for worthiness to promote a healthy and successful future for Lisk.</p>

        <h2>How Do I Vote?</h2>
        <p>Currently you may use <a href="https://lisk.io/download">Lisk Nano</a>. Lisk Nano is a program you can download to your windows or mac computer. From there you can access your funds, send/receive funds, create a second pass phrase, register as a delegate, or vote. During the voting process it costs 1 Lisk to vote and you may vote for 33 delegates in one vote. You can vote up to 101 delegates. To vote all 101 delegates it would cost you 4 LSK total. Voting for delegates helps the system as forgers are generally people who contribute to Lisk. As a perk some delegates provide rewards for voting for them.</p>

        <h2>What Is Forging?</h2>
        <p>Forging is done by the top 101 delegates. Lisk network automatically generates brand new LSK and assigns which delegate is in line for receiving forging rewards. This is incentive for the delegates to support the network. Forging rewards decrease over time.</p>

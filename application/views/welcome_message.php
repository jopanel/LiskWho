        <p>Lisk is plagued by delegates who receive free Lisk without contributing towards the Lisk community. It's time we change that. It is imperative that the top 101 delegates who earn Lisk from forging are people who are contributing to Lisk and not buying votes by sharing rewards. Delegates must be vetted for worthiness to promote a healthy and successful future for Lisk.</p>
